# EEGsignalAnalysis

Matlab scripts for EEG signal filtration, artifact detection and ERP calculation. Also contains small scripts for ERP peak amplitude and latency calculation.
Calculate peaks MAD of amplitude and latency, Inter Trial Consistency, ERSP, ITPC.
Wavelets transform is used for frequency domain parameters calculation
PCA and k-means atre used for dimention reduction of the final dataset

APICE pipeline functions are used in the script, for more info see : Fl√≥ A, Gennari G, Benjamin L, Dehaene-Lambertz G. Automated Pipeline for Infants Continuous EEG (APICE): A flexible pipeline for developmental cognitive studies. Dev Cogn Neurosci. 2022 Apr;54:101077. doi: 10.1016/j.dcn.2022.101077. Epub 2022 Jan 25. PMID: 35093730; PMCID: PMC8804179.

Please note : this script has been created for a very specific experimental paradigm with precise triggers created during EEG recording.
